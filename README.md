Hi there.

This is my first original program.  I have very little programing experience, just some C++ about 20 years ago.  So, I don't know a lot.

Plan for this program is a terminal based Kanban Board.
Starting planned features include:
- creating a saved file
- letting you add new tasks, with priority
- change tasks
- add new tiles to your board
- save to file.
